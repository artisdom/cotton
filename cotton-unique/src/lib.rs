//! Implementing statistically-unique per-device IDs based on chip IDs
//!
//! The cotton-unique crate encapsulates the creation of per-device unique
//! identifiers -- for things such as Ethernet MAC addresses, or UPnP UUIDs.
//!
//! Most microcontrollers (e.g. STM32, RA6M5) have a unique per-unit
//! identifier built-in; RP2040 does not, but on that platform it's intended
//! to use the unique identifier in the associated SPI flash chip instead.
//!
//! But it's not a good idea to just use the raw chip ID as the MAC
//! address, for several reasons: it's the wrong size, it's quite
//! predictable (it's not 96 random bits per chip, it typically
//! encodes the chip batch number and die position on the wafer, so
//! two different STM32s might have IDs that differ only in one or two
//! bits, meaning we can't just pick any 46 bits from the 96 in case
//! we accidentally pick seldom-changing ones) â€” and, worst of all, if
//! anyone were to use the same ID for anything else later, they might
//! be surprised if it were very closely correlated with the device's
//! MAC address.
//!
//! So the thing to do, is to hash the unique ID along with a key, or
//! salt, which indicates what we're using it for. The result is thus
//! deterministic and consistent on any one device for a particular
//! salt, but varies from one device to another (and from one salt to
//! another).
//!
//! For instance, the cotton-ssdp device tests obtain a MAC address by
//! hashing the STM32 unique ID with the salt string "stm32-eth", and
//! UPnP UUIDs by hashing the *same* ID with a *different* salt.
//!
//! This does not *guarantee* uniqueness, but if the has function is
//! doing its job, the odds of a collision involve a factor of 2^-64 --
//! or in other words are highly unlikely.
